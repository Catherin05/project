<h1>Green Life</h1>

This is a static website developed using HTML,CSS languages and W3 framework.

 “If you cut a tree, you kill a life. If you save a tree, you save a life. If you plant a tree, you plant a life.” – Trees make the environment cleaner and provide us with oxygen.

Green living is a lifestyle. Basically, it's making choices that conserve and preserve the Earth's natural resources and habitats.

Without plants, essentially all life would starve to death.Even carnivores need plants because their food – other animals – eat plants. Without the nutrients that come from green things, human health suffers significantly.
